# ds000000 - MRIQC derivatives

This dataset is a BIDS Derivatives dataset resulting from running MRIQC vVERSION on [ds000000](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000000).

## Methods

MRIQC documentation can be found on https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/.

Jobs were submitted using [ReproMan](https://reproman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in order to improve reproducibility. Output and error logs can be found in .reproman/jobs/local/.
